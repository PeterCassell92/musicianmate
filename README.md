## Table of Contents

## Overview
For our third Project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course we had 10 days to build a fullstack web app in group of three. The scale of this project has been the biggest one so far in the course, and this has also been the first time we worked collaboratively using Git.

Our project was inspired by two of the internet's biggest music platforms - Spotify and Soundcloud. The goal was to build a music listening service with a social media aspect to it. Users can upload, comment, like and share songs as well as build playlist, albums, create artists and manage artist profiles.

## Brief
- Build a full-stack application by making our own back-end and front-end
- Work in team using git to code collaboratively
- Use an Express API to serve our data from a Mongo database
- Consume the API with a front-end built with REACT
- Have a complete product with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 and Bulma
- JavaScript (ES6)
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express 
- React Jinke Music Player
- Cloudinary
- Mongo and Mongoose
- Git and GitHub
- Google Chrome Dev Tools
- Heroku and Netlify


## Approach
As we knew the scale of our project would be quite big, our initial step was to focus on a thorough whiteboarding process, creating all of our models, sketching out components and discussing in detail the complex relationships between our schemas.
